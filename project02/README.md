# Project Description:

In this project, you will be creating a bank account calculator that can process withdraws and deposits, calculate interest, and apply overdraft fees. The program must be implemented in a file called "bank_account.cpp" (and you need to also provide a "bank_account.hpp" header file) and must have a number of functions.

The most important function is named process_commands. It takes as arguments a multiline string (where each line of the string denotes a date and an instruction) and a double denoting the Annual Percent Rate (apr, i.e. the interest rate for the account). This function returns a multiline string denoting the results of performing the instructions requested.
