Project Description:

You will be writing many functions that involve searching for a string for a certain pattern. The simplest case is looking for an exact match. For instance, the pattern string "Mal" can be found in the text "My dog's name is Mal.". All of the functions can be switched to a case insensitive version with an argument. With a case insensitive function, the pattern "MAL", "mal", and "Mal" will all find a match, but "cat" will still fail on the previous text example.

Additionally the pattern string can contain special characters that match a set of possible text characters:

  The '%' character can match any other single character. 

  The '#' character can match any single digit character.

The text is guaranteed not contain either of these special characters.
